        Bob's Auto Repair first opened in 1987. Bob and one mechanic, fixing
        cars and meeting new people. We quickly outgrew that shop and eventually
        moved into our current building. Over the years, we have come to know
        our customers like family. We have seen marriages, births, graduations
        and other milestones. It has been our pleasure to be a part of your
        lives. We understand the importance and necessity of having a dependable
        vehicle, and are honored to be in charge of that task in your lives.
        Thank you for your trust in us, thank you for sending your friends and
        family our way, and thank you for 30 years of serving you!
